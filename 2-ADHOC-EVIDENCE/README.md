# Adhoc ECDO evidence

This directory contains evidence of the ECDO which is not necessarily scientific in nature. Often, it consists of traces of past ECDO events in meatspace, geological data, or human memory. But it can also refer to human behavior or other phenomena concerning the potential impending ECDO event.

## Contents

Old evidence:
- `ancient-myths`: Myths that may reference past ECDO events.
- `bible`: Investigation of potentially relevant accounts from the Bible.  
- `physical-evidence`: Physical evidence of past or impending ECDO events, such as flash-frozen animals or big rocks high up in the mountains.
- `human-built-structures`: Structures built by humans potentially related to ECDO events.
- `solar-system`: Evidence from the solar system.
- `history`: Learning from history.
- `bond-events`: Are ice rafting events related to the ECDO?

Modern, recent evidence:
- `elite-preparation`: The elites seem to be preparing for... something.
- `government-intervention`: Investigating potential government intervention related to the ECDO, such as attempting to stop/delay the ECDO or censoring information about it.
- `research`: Research related to the ECDO.

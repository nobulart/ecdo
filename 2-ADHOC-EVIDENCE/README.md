# Adhoc ECDO evidence

This directory contains evidence of the ECDO which is not necessarily scientific in nature. Often, it consists of traces of past ECDO events in meatspace, geological data, or human memory. But it can also refer to human behavior or other phenomena concerning the potential impending ECDO event.

## Contents

- `ancient-myths`: Myths that may reference past ECDO events.
- `physical-evidence`: Physical evidence of past ECDO events, such as flash-frozen animals or big rocks high up in the mountains.
- `human-built-structures`: Structures built by humans potentially related to ECDO events.
- `government-intervention`: Investigating potential government intervention related to the ECDO, such as attempting to stop/delay the ECDO or censoring information about it.

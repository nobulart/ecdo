# Evidence for past ECDOs

This directory contains evidence of the ECDO which is not necessarily scientific in nature. Often, it consists of traces of past ECDO events in meatspace, geological data, or human memory.

For example:
- frozen animals, frozen slushes of organic matter
- big rocks in certain mountains
- myths

- Worlds in Collision and Earth in Upheaval

## Isaiah 24

17Terror and the pit and the snared
are upon you, O inhabitant of the earth!
18He who flees at the sound of the terror
shall fall into the pit,
and he who climbs out of the pit
shall be caught in the snare.
For the windows of heaven are opened,
and the foundations of the earth tremble.
19The earth is utterly broken,
the earth is split apart,
the earth is violently shaken.
20The earth staggers like a drunken man;
it sways like a hut;
its transgression lies heavy upon it,
and it falls, and will not rise again.

## Genesi 7:11

When Noah was 600 years old, on the seventeenth day of the second month, all the underground waters erupted from the earth, and the rain fell in mighty torrents from the sky.

# Europe Ancient Flood Myths

## Crete (Greece)

Historical account of the Crete catastrophes (1750 BC), explicit mention made of the direction from which water came during the first event: "great tidal waves moved towards the island from the north and swept over it", as would be predicted of the Aegean Sea during a State 1 to State 2 rotation. It is also described that the second catastrophe, 50 years later, was dominated by volcanism and earthquakes.

## Kataklysmos and Ekpyrosis

Censorinus makes mention of this water/fire sequence as being coincident to a planetary cycle in De Die Natali (238 AD): "There is a period called 'the supreme year' by Aristotle, at the end of which the sun, moon and all the planets return to their original position. This 'supreme year' has a great winter, called by the Greeks 'kataklysmos', which means deluge, and a great summer, called by the Greeks 'ekpyrosis' or combustion of the world. The world, actually, seems to be inundated and burned alternately in each of these epochs".

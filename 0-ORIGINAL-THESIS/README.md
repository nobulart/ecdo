# ECDO (Exothermic Core-Mantle Decoupling - Dzhanibekov Oscillation)

This folder is dedicated 

The [original ECDO thesis](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/23/master-exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-theory/) is written by The Ethical Skeptic.

Notably, he breaks his thesis down into 3 parts:
- The Earth's warming being caused by the core exerting heat into the mantle
- What the Pyramid of Giza tells us
- Dzhanibekov oscillation

The key point to understand here is that this thesis is not a random dart throw but was a progressive process of figuring things out, as outlined in his three theses.

I consider recreating his proofs to be of the highest priority. That work belongs in folder `2-FULL-THEORY-BREAKDOWN`.

## ECDO S1 to S2 Rotation

Pivots are the two points which don't change their rotational paths during the ECDO event.

The western pivot near Mount Roraima rotates counter-clockwise.

The eastern pivot in Indonesia rotates clockwise.

Pivots are very close to the equator; the western pivot is slightly above it and the eastern pivot slightly below.

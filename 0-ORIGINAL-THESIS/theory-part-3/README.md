# Theory Part 3: Exothermic Core-Mantle Dzhanibekov Oscillation (ECDO) 

## Summary

Of course, the killer thesis. It makes a jump in logic, which may or may not be true until it can be verified. But the flooding of the Khafre pyramid, creates a necessity, for some kind of mechanism, which could have brought this about in the past, may again, and may be linked to the reality of core heating.

The (measured) assumptions are:
1. Weakening of Earth's magnetic moment
2. Heating of the Earth's mantle from the core
3. Resulting in heating of the ocean and carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere

The next propositions are:
4. Once past a specific threshold of reduced magnetic moment, the mantle gyroscopically rotates, through a phenomenon like the Dzhanibekov rotation

Key questions for me:
- How do we know the core-mantle are magnetically coupled?
- Difficulties understanding the Dzhanibekov effect starting with the finding of the principal axes of inertia of an object in rotation including the Earth
    - math definition: eigenvectors of the inertia tensor
    - inertia tensor?

Another big assumption: The flip is not 180 degrees for Earth, but 104 degrees, based on the "three PIM-axis" aka "Mundi and Euler dense axes". These are more context-rich axes, that are more predictive in this scenario due to the nature of the rotation.

The center of the LLVM structure structures is perpendicular to the centers of the ocean heating. This is seen as not coincidental.

The point that rotates to the North Pole is the lighter LLVM, which is in South Africa's cusp. The angle between the axis of this point through the center of the Earth is 104 degrees from the North Pole. The South Pole would then become a point in the Pacific, around Hawaii.

The points on the Earth which stay fixed wrt the relative rotation of the Earth around its axis, are the points perpendicular to the two LLVM lightweight centroids, which are the centers of the heating of the Earth's surface from the mantle. These are in north South America and Indonesia.

Finally, to tie it all together, the author points to the Pyramid of Khafre and the angle of its two shafts. This pyramid lies on the same longitude line as the lighter LLVM centroid in South Africa. The angle between the two shafts is 104 degrees, which means it may have been intentionally constructed as a measurement tool for this Dzhanibekov rotation of the Earth. The shafts, in turn, point towards the North Pole in the state of Earth before and after the pole flip.

That's essentially it. Another question I have is why does the Earth's North Pole differ from the current rotational axis by 22 degrees? After we change from Africa being at the North Pole, do we have a slow regression back to the present rotational alignment or is there an intermediate step where the Earth's rotational axis is aligned with a different North Pole? Perhaps, near the current (lopsided) rotational axis in the Arctic.

# Mapping the ECDO Deluge/Flooding

This topic is so central to prepping for the ECDO that I am giving it its own directory.

The goal is to map out all flood locations over the world, to know not only which places might be safe, but which places will likely be in danger of flooding, and to gather evidence for past ECDO events in the process.

## Contribution Guidelines

For starters, all locations will be nested in a directory pertaining to the relevant continent or major area of the world. More nesting can be added within each continent if the amount of information demands.

Images can be included as files, optionally embedded in Markdown, or included in PDFs.

It should be clear what data is being used as evidence for potential, past or likely flooding of certain areas.

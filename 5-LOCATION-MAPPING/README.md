# Investigating Safe Locations for the ECDO Deluge/Flooding

This folder is intended to be one of the prime jewels of this repo.

The goal is to map out all locations over the world, and evaluate them in context of the ECDO, telling us which locations might be safe, which might be dangerous, and gathering evidence for the ECDO in the process.

## Contribution Guidelines

For starters, all locations will be nested in a directory pertaining to the relevant continent or major area of the world. More nesting can be added within each continent if the amount of information demands.

Images can be included as files, optionally embedded in Markdown, or included in PDFs.

It should be clear what data is being used as evidence for potential, past or likely flooding of certain areas.

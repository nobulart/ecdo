# Andes

The Andes have to deal with the Pacific hitting them from the west at speeds probably up to 1000 km/h when returning from S2>S1.

Yes, I saw this. The Andes are a possibility. Problem with high places is that there is a lot of material to fall on top of you when the earth shakes.

Mountainous regions like the Andes will be less susceptible to water, but will be dangerous due to falling debris and renewed orogeny (mountain building).

South America. The western ECDO pivot [1] is located near Mount Roraima.[2] Mega current ripples and salt deposits in Argentina and Chile, and apparent gully erosion morphology in the vicinity of Drake Passage are in agreement with the predicted movement.[3]

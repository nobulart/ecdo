Do you know what could be another factor here? If S2 climate conditions are very different from S1, then plants and animals that survive the inundation might perish from that change alone.

Europe and the Med seem to be in a similar latitude in both S1 and 2, so maybe that gives life an extra chance of surviving the cycle?

Just a thought.

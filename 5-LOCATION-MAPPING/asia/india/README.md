# India

Seems that there could be some safe spots in India.

Promising locations:
- Varanasi
	- Long way inland, well protected by the Himalayas during S1 -> S2, and a minimum of 800-900km land buffering between the cities and the coast on the S2 -> S1 rotation.
- Doddabetta Peak in Ooty

May be spared the worst of it by the Himalayas, going from S1 to S2. Tibet will be inundated for sure.

Many ancient and massive pyramid like structures to be found across India, such as the Chola temples.

However, real trial may be the return (S2 -> S1).

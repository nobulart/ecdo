Remarkable channel erosion type morphology between Sri Lanka and India following the ECDO path. Sri Lanka has the characteristic teardrop form which some islands take on in fast flowing rivers. Third image is from Mars.

India & Sri Lanka (incl. Mohenjo-Daro). ECDO rotations S1>S2 and S2>S1. The new model provides a hint of seiche. Greyscale elevation and false-colour bathymetry. Mars megaflood erosion with a teardrop island (flow would have been from the bottom of the image to the top) [1]. Red lines are ECDO displacement path [2]. Tamil flood story: "Half of the land mass Kumari Kandam, which was south of India, sank in a great flood, destroying the first Tamil Sangam (literary academy). The people moved to the other half and established the second Tamil Sangam there, but the rest of Kumari too sank beneath the sea. The lone survivor was a Tamil prince named Thirumaaran, who managed to rescue some Tamil literary classics and swim with them to present-day Tamil Nadu." [3]

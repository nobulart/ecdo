Nobulart:

This is the diamond coast, from Oranjemund northwards. See the flow indications running north from the coast here. It comes at least 50km inland (probably more). I haven´t looked closely here yet, but i´d say that everything to the west of the red line (the ECDO moment) would be at risk returning from S2 to S1.

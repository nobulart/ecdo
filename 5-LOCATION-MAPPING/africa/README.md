# South Africa

Appears safe from deluge from S1 to S2.

...[recommend] Drakensberg. The entire globe will be plunged into a nuclear-type winter during S2. It's going to be cold everywhere. Southern Africa is uniquely oriented and positioned such that it is not inundated during either movement - I know this because the "youngest" marine fossils here (found in the Karoo) are over 6 million years old. I believe I know why it isn't inundated going from S2>S1 but I have not yet published this.

Southern Africa also has some of the longest continuously inhabited caves in the world - many of them showing signs of continuous human activity for over 200,000 years.

Absolutely. There is a reason that Thomas, White Hapgood and the movie "2012" all singled out southern africa as the safest place (and possibly why the Oppenheimers chose to live here).

Southern Africa, especially above the Drakensberg range, is the safest from both water and falling rocks, but it will experience high winds, quakes and possibly some volcanic activity.

# Southern Africa

Southern Africa, "The Cradle of Humankind" [1]. Seemingly has no cultural flood stories that I have found. Bears no evidence of marine inundation within the past 66 million years.[2] Has some of the longest continuously inhabited caves, some with habitation periods spanning tens of thousands of years, and going back 250ka.[3] The shallow (50-150m) Agulhas Bank and the (7500ft) Swartberg and (11,400ft) Drakensberg Mountains would present a bow-shaped aspect to the oncoming water during S2>S1, much like that of a ship, possibly diverting most of the flow. [4][5][6] The long NS striations along the western diamond coast of Namibia suggest large volumes of water may have washed up there, and that those famous stones weren't carried dozens of kilometers up the coast and inland from Oranjemund by any ordinary ocean current.[7] Red line is the ECDO displacement path.

# Nobulart

“The area bounded by Zaire, South Africa, and Kenya suffers only severe earthquakes and winds – little inundation. Survivors there marvel at the Sun, standing still in the sky for nearly half a day.” - TAES, Chan Thomas (1963)

# Approximate height

160m above current sea level from the erosion of the pyramids on the Giza plateau.

1000m+ at the equator (historical accounts from many places).

The highest points near the pivots should be the calmest places. No inundation. Little wind. Quakes and volcanic activity only. Mount Roraima in South America and Sulawesi in Indonesia.

# General Heuristics for Evaluating Locations

This folder is dedicated for general heuristics applicable for any location in evaluating its safety.

## Contents

- `biodiversity-hotspots`: Using biodiversity hotspots as indicators for potential safe areas.
- `land-elevation`: Land elevation.
- `flood-height`: Predicting how high the ocean displacement will flood.
- `oldest-cities`: Using old cities as indicators for potential safe areas.

## Additional potential useful heuristics

Additional potential heuristics:
- minimum distance from pivots
- protection from wind
- temperature
- proximity to fault lines
- Longest continuous inhabitation
- Longest standing tall structures

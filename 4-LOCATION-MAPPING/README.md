# Investigating Safe Locations for the ECDO Deluge/Flooding

This folder is intended to be one of the prime jewels of this repo.

The goal is to map out all locations over the world, and evaluate them in context of the ECDO, telling us which locations might be safe, which might be dangerous, and gathering evidence for the ECDO in the process.

This is one of the most important parts of preparing for the ECDO event. Ideally, `README.md` files for all locations will be thoughtful, comprehensive, and data-driven.

## Directory Organization

The directory is organized into information about specific locations in continent folders, and `0-general-heuristics` for heuristics for evaluating a location wrt the ECDO event.

## Basic Contribution Guidelines

Locations are bucketed in a tree-manner, and should be put in the proper folder.

Graphics should be added into `img/` folders in the relevant location and can also be embedded into the Markdown files.

`README.md` files for continent directories should only contain information about the general continent. Information about specific locations belongs in subfolders within the continent folder.

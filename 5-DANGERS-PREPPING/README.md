# Prepping for an ECDO event

Aside from a flood map, this directory is for all things prepping. Of course, the primary concern is finding the locations that are likely to be safe in the oceanic displacement, and the flood mapping will be helpful for that.

But this directory is also made for all things subsequent, such as temperature, earthquakes, volcanoes, and materials, tools, and plans that will be helpful for ensuring optimal handling of the ECDO event.

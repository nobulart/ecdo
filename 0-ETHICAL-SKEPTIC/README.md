# Ethical Skeptic

This folder is dedicated to information related to Ethical Skeptic, the author of the original ECDO thesis.

His website is [here](https://theethicalskeptic.com/) where you can find his thesis.

Notably, he breaks his thesis down into 3 parts:
- The Earth's warming being caused by the core exerting heat into the mantle
- What the Pyramid of Giza tells us
- Dzhanibekov oscillation

The key point to understand here is that this thesis is not a random dart throw but was a progressive process of figuring things out.

Highly recommend reading all 3 and not just taking them at face value but actually recreating the mathematical "proofs" on your own.

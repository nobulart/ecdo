"During the Manu deluge the flood was probably super high. Only 1 mountain peak in himalaya was visible called navabandhana.
Current highest peaks are around 8000m. I do suspect there might be changes in between of heights of himalaya as this happened at the end of golden age."

In the manu story they mention that the only highest peak of himalayas was dry called navabandhan. 
So, i do guess himalayas were present in previous deluge as well.
By the way how can we say himalayas are relatively new range?

# Oldest Flood Deluge in Indian mythology

One deluge that started the golden age - Kritayuga.

# Tamil flood

I just noticed that the Tamil flood story is describing two consecutive events. The sinking of the (now submerged) southern land [S1>S2], and then when theyâ€™ve just set up shop again the same thing happens again, submerging land further north [S2>S1]. Very much like the Crete account. Be nice to find a possible date on the Tamil account.

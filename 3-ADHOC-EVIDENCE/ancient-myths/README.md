# Mythical ECDO evidence

Goal: Find all myths that reference a potential ECDO event.

## List of Myths that potentially reference ECDO

TODO: The following list should be bucketed into location files.

Historical account of the Crete catastrophes (1750 BC), explicit mention made of the direction from which water came during the first event: "great tidal waves moved towards the island from the north and swept over it", as would be predicted of the Aegean Sea during a State 1 to State 2 rotation. It is also described that the second catastrophe, 50 years later, was dominated by volcanism and earthquakes.

Censorinus makes mention of this water/fire sequence as being coincident to a planetary cycle in De Die Natali (238 AD): "There is a period called 'the supreme year' by Aristotle, at the end of which the sun, moon and all the planets return to their original position. This 'supreme year' has a great winter, called by the Greeks 'kataklysmos', which means deluge, and a great summer, called by the GReeks 'ekpyrosis' or combustion of the world. The world, actually, seems to be inundated and burned alternately in each of these epochs".

kataklysmos and ekpyrosis to the greeks

Mohenjo 

Peru, story of the Sun standing still in the sky. (If the Sun was near noon when the rotation started it may ha ve appeared stationary).

In Southern South America myths of the sun setting in the wrong place.

Malaysian and Sumatran stories describe a long night they feared would never end.

The Bible, Egyptian legends and other stories from antiquity describe a solar event, often involving a black sun.

The Great Idol of Tiahuanaco (1959)

## Misc

Great pyramids may be the pillars of Joachim and Boaz, serving to both remind and anticipate the timing of the event.

## Cave art

I've found some interesting literature in a Creswell Crags Education visitors book I bought on the internet. Will post when I get time but I suspect two cave art depictions of triangles which they believe are vulvas (lol) may actually be pyramids rotated 90 degrees.

When you open it click on the number 1 "Vulva" and rotate it clockwise and it morphs into a pyramid. The bottom right corner is covered by calcite.

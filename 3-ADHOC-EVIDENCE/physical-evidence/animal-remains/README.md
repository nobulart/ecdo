# Fairbanks Mammoth 1948

Mining team uncovered the frozen remains of a young mammoth in Fairbanks. Lush vegetation in its mouth showed that the animal died during the growing season in an apparently warm climate.

Secondly the animal had been frozen immediately after death, since its flesh was said to be edible.

So a mammoth foraging in the summertime was almost instantaneously frozen and remained so for 20 millenia.

# Alaska Frozen Mosquito

Dig at the remains of a sunken prehistoric tropical lake community between Nome and Kotzebue, Alaska. While digging, an archaelogist unearthed a mosquito that flew away after thawing. In order for a mosquito to be revived after being frozen, its freezing would have to be followed by a sharp and permanent drop in temperature. Normal freezing would have caused ice crystals to grow within the creature, rupturing the membranes. So it was freezing in a sudden deep freezing.

# Animal remains

However I don't think the boulder clay was deposited by melting glaciers though and think a deluge buried the old coastline. I'll send some pictures from a book a local Geography teacher wrote which you might find interesting

Note on this one that at the base of the buried cliff are bones of hippopotamus, rhinoceros and hyena. These were either deposited by ice sheets our buried there after a production of the lion king. Or smashed by a deluge in the not too distant past.

# Flash frozen?

That was Chan proposed mechanism - supersonic wind speeds and water due to the rotation.

# Book

Reliquoæ Diluvianæ (1823)
A 380 page record of an historic deluge, overflowing with findings of numerous species of fauna which had no explicable reason to be found together, scattered across Britain and Europe, buried in layers of 'diluvium' (a term coined by Buckland).

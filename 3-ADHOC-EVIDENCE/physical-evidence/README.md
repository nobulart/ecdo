# Clay

Varved clay proxies provide sub-annular paleomagnetic resolutions. The following charts are taken from Annual and inter‐annual magnetic variations in varved clay, Nils‐Axel Mörner (1978)[1], wherein paleomagnetic findings from VC cores dated to ±13,150 BP (spanning 156 varves/years) and ±10,000 BP (spanning 300 varves/years) are shown. These two cores span the Gothenburg Flip & Excursion[2] and the Ornö Declination Departure.

What appears to be recorded in these proxies are  multiple geomagnetic excursions and reversals which occurred within short succession, most within a few years to a couple of decades apart, with the majority reflecting a declination change of 80°-120°. This looks very much like what I would expect to see recorded from a series of ECDO-type events[3].

Coloured elements are my own additions. Blue and red indicate selected reversal points of magnetic declination. Orange numbers are the approximate number of varves/years between the reversals. Green curves and text indicate the approximate number of degrees change between the selected reversals. Raw chart values which exceed 180° have been subtracted from 360° and the absolute delta value displayed bracketed.

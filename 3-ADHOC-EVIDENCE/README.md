# Evidence for past ECDOs

This directory contains evidence of the ECDO which is not necessarily scientific in nature. Often, it consists of traces of past ECDO events in meatspace, geological data, or human memory.

For example:
- frozen animals, frozen slushes of organic matter
- big rocks in certain mountains
- myths

# Information that belongs in another folder

Scientific models belong not here but in `2-FULL-THEORY-BREAKDOWN`.

Evidence or information primarily relevant to the impending rotation belong in `4-MONITORING-PRESENT-ROTATION`.

# Misc

The unusually mineral rich composition of the crust here probably has something to do with the LLSVP intrusion and the Vredefort crater which exposed some of what was below. Agreed on the alternate concepts - I find valuable knowledge in most areas of inquiry, especially if its something new to me.

# Frequency of ECDO event

Goal: Predict how frequent the ECDO event is.

## Historical Accounts

`ADHOC-EVIDENCE/ancient-myths` is a good place to start looking into regarding accounts of past ECDO events.

### Gas giant harmonic overlaid with bond events: 3700 years

Check `ADHOC-EVIDENCE/solar-system`.

### Historically Notable Date - 3700 years ago

There are a lot of records in myths and human history indicating there may have been an ECDO event 3700 years ago, somewhere around 1700 BC - 1750 BC.

Try doing a `grep -nr` in this repo on 3700, 1700, and 1750.

### 5200 BC

Check `ADHOC-EVIDENCE/bible` for info regarding a biblical flood.

## 3700 increments? Noah's flood and Younger Dryas

That's 3700 years ago (1700BC). Take off another 3700 and we're at 5400BC (noah's flood). Take another 3700 off and we're at 9100BC. End of the Younger Dryas.

## Nobulart

Still trying to get my head around how 1700BC fits into this cycle. Crete, Turkey, China, Pakistan (Mohenjo-Daro) all have a record of an event or events at this time. The other niggle is the bond cycle, which indicates massive ice-melt events every 1000-1500 years, many of them coincident with known megaflood accounts.

I think its happened several times since then. At the very least another one around 1750BC, but this may be the fourth or fifth. I think the motion will likely be the same as it has been during this 12ky period.

## TODO

There's some data from Earth core/soil data showing evidence of past geomagnetic excursions. That would be good to investigate and put in here.

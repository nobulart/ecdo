# Human Built ECDO-related Structures

This folder is for structures humans have built that are potentially related to ECDO events.

## Khafre

"I don't know how to make this clearer: Any story regarding the construction/dating of Khufu and Khafre must definitively address this karst erosion feature—otherwise, it is not a scientific hypothesis, rather narrative dogma." - Ethical Skeptic

Stone depiction in Khufu south air shaft was carved around 9,200 BC. This is very close to 3 x 3,700 years ago.

## Babylon

"The walls of the mighty Babylon and the eight-volved Tower of Babel or cloud-encompassed Bel were never constructed to resist any mortal foe. NO. Those city walls, which were 60 miles in circumference, 200 feet high, 578 feet thick, were not made to defy the strength of armies, but to resist the fearful forces of Nature, the floods that swept the plains of Shinar, from the mountains of Armenia, every spring during this Age of Horror. The tremendous embankments and river walls constructed by the Ancients are monuments of human skill and enterprise belonging to an epoch that antedates by thousands of years the Age of their supposed builders." - Thomas H. Burgoyne, The Light of Egypt - Vol. I (1889)

"This accounts for and fully explains the existence of fossil remains of the seal, walrus and polar bear in the burning plains of Africa and Hindustan, and of the tropical remains now being discovered in the Arctic regions."

This would very likely have been expunged from recent records, going to try to find his source, which would predate 1889.

## Canaanite palace from 3700 years ago

“It really looks like the earth simply opened up and everything on either side of it fell in,” Cline said. “It’s unlikely that the destruction was caused by violent human activity because there are no visible signs of fire, no weapons such as arrows that would indicate a battle, nor any unburied bodies related to combat.”

“You put everything together – no fire, quick collapse, no gradual disintegration of the roof – this is equal to a violent event that caused the collapse and that big crack cutting through the palace in the orientation of the fissure,” says Yasur-Landau. “You don’t need to be Sherlock in order to deduce that this was the result of a geological event."

## Gobekli Tepe

Confirming TES' speculated built date in the period after the YDB. I'm thinking Gobleke Tepe was built during the previous stable period. So there was an event that triggered the constuction of GT as an observatory, which is starting to make it look as though the 'YDB Event' might more properly be called the BAI Event.

My thinking is that it was built to watch for whatever we encountered around 12,800 BC that upset the apple cart. It's possible that the focus on interpreting GT should be expanded to include consideration of the stars at that earlier time. It would have possibly been more likely to have been built during the warmer insterstadia than the cooler YD.

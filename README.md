# ECDO (Exothermic Core-Mantle Decoupling - Dzhanibekov Oscillation)

This repeo is intended to be a thoughtbank for brainstorming the ECDO thesis and all things related to it.

Organization of the repo is mainly done through self-explanatory directory/file names. Information is written into Markdown (`.md`) files named `README.md`, and images/videos are placed into `img/` folders at each step of the directory tree.

Emphasis is placed on optimal data organization which minimizes redundancy and optimizes finding information.

## Main Folder Contents

Following are the main folders of the repo along with their purpose. There is bound to be some overlap but I have made the categories as discrete as possible.

1. `0-ETHICAL-SKEPTIC`: Information pertaining to or coming from Ethical Skeptic, the author of the original ECDO hypothesis.
2. `1-NOBULART`: Information pertaining to or coming from Nobulart, a close follower of the ECDO hypothesis.
3. `2-FULL-THEORY-BREAKDOWN`: A scientific derivation of the ECDO hypothesis.
4. `3-ADHOC-EVIDENCE`: A collection of evidence of past ECDO events.
5. `4-MONITORING-PRESENT-ROTATION`: Information pertaining to the impending ECDO event.
6. `5-LOCATION-MAPPING`: Mapping out how different areas of the world will fare during an ECDO event.
7. `6-DANGERS-PREPPING`: All matters pertaining to preparing for an ECDO event aside from location.

## Basic Contribution Guidelines

1. Put information in the proper location in the proper format
	- Information goes in the folder where it belongs and nowhere else. If a new folder needs to be made, do it in the proper location.
	- Folders and files should always be named properly, with concise and meaningful names. To put multiple words into a filename, connect the words with dashes (`-`). Names should always be lowercase, not camel case.
	- Text goes into `README.md` files, and graphic files into `img/` folders. Feel free to inline images into the Markdown.
2. Don't add noise
	- In order to make this repo as high signal as possible, avoid adding in sloppy analysis. Don't just copy paste things in, but add in useful analysis based on data.
	- Use English, with proper spelling and grammar.
	- When possible, add links and references.

## Additional Contribution Guidelines

Do NOT dump information into high-level `README.md` files just because you don't know where else to put it. `README.md` files are not data dumps but polished analysis of one specific topic. They should be organized and easily readable.

Some images are meaningful on their own, but others require explaining. Rather than use `img/` as an image dump, images should generally be referenced in Markdown and useful insights gleaned from them explained.

Information in other languages can be put in `/translation` folders within the relevant directory.

All pull requests will be reviewed to ensure optimal information structure.

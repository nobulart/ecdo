# ECDO (Exothermic Core-Mantle Decoupling - Dzhanibekov Oscillation)

This repeo is intended to be a thoughtbank for brainstorming the ECDO thesis and all things related to it.

Organization of the repo is mainly done through self-explanatory directory/filenames and README files at each step of the directory tree.

Emphasis is placed on optimal data organization which minimizes redundancy and optimizes retrieving data.

## Guideline for Contributing

Put data in the proper location by editing existing files or adding new files. If a new file/folder needs to be made, make it in the proper location and use concise and meaningful names without spaces. For example, to add information about areas safe from inundation in Germany, you could add a file `germany.md` in `6-flood-mapping/europe/`.

Use English with proper spelling and grammar. Information in other languages can be put in `/translation` folders within the relevant directory.

Encode information in Markdown files or PDF files. To store image files, put them in `/img` folders in the relevant directory.

All pull requests will be reviewed to ensure optimal information structure.

If you put information in the proper place, it shouldn't be duplicated without good reason.

## Repo main folder contents

Following are the main folders of the repo and what their purpose is. There is bound to be some overlap but I have made the categories as discrete as possible. Contributing information should always go in the proper location.

1. `0-ETHICAL-SKEPTIC`: Information pertaining to or coming from Ethical Skeptic, the author of the original ECDO hypothesis.
2. `1-NOBULART`: Information pertaining to or coming from Nobulart, a close follower of the ECDO hypothesis.
3. `2-FULL-THEORY-BREAKDOWN`: A scientific analysis of the ECDO hypothesis.
4. `3-ADHOC-EVIDENCE`: A collection of evidence of past ECDO events.
5. `4-MONITORING-PRESENT-ROTATION`: Information pertaining to the impending ECDO event.
6. `5-LOCATION-MAPPING`: Mapping out how different areas of the world will fare during an ECDO event.
7. `6-DANGERS-PREPPING`: All matters pertaining to preparing for an ECDO event aside from location.

## Things To Be Done (among many others)

Map out flood areas for the whole world.

Gather a great collection of evidence for the event.

Complete recreations of the proofs that predict the rotation and also imply the specific new pole crust surface points (Africa, Pacific).

Create translations so people can ECDO-pill other people easier.

The accelerating weakening of our magnetic field suggest that we may already be quite some years into the event. If you've watched the videos of the Dzhanibkeov effect, its seen that when the actual flip occurs, it's quick (12-24 hrs), which is supported by deluge debris evidence.

It is not determined. It is an estimate based on the nature of the Dzhanibekov effect (a 180 degree flip normally occurs in one half rotation of the main axis), historic accounts describing the sun/stars/moon standing still, and the geological evidence for water volume, flow depths and inundation extent. As example, the only way the Mediterranean could have inundated most of northern Africa would be if this was a rapid event. It is almost definitely in the range of 6-24 hours. 12 hours is probably a bit conservative. Closer to 6 more likely, being roughly half a Dzhanibekov.

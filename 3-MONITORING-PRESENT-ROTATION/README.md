# Monitoring the Present Rotation

This folder aims to be as accurate of a progress indicator as possible on the current impending rotation.

## Contents

- `date`: Predicting when S1 -> S2 will begin.
- `north-pole-wander`: Tracking the wandering of the north magnetic pole.
- `recent-natural-disasters`: Tracking natural disasters which may have an uptick because of the ECDO.
- `shudder`: Referencing a vague imminent phenomenon that Ethical Skeptic referred to on social media.

## Information that belongs elsewhere

Speculation on how long S1 -> S2 will take belongs [here](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/1-FULL-THESIS-BREAKDOWN/s1-to-s2/README.md) in `1-FULL-THESIS-BREAKDOWN/s1-to-s2/`.

Speculation on how frequent the ECDO is also belongs in `1-FULL-THESIS-BREAKDOWN/`.

Evidence on past ECDO events belongs not here, but in `2-ADHOC-EVIDENCE`.

## TODO

- investigate additional data feeds related to the ECDO such as temperature

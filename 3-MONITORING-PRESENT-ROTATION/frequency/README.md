Still trying to get my head around how 1700BC fits into this cycle. Crete, Turkey, China, Pakistan (Mohenjo-Daro) all have a record of an event or events at this time. The other niggle is the bond cycle, which indicates massive ice-melt events every 1000-1500 years, many of them coincident with known megaflood accounts.

I think its happened several times since then. At the very least another one around 1750BC, but this may be the fourth or fifth. I think the motion will likely be the same as it has been during this 12ky period.

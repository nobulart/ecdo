# ECDO S1 to S2 Rotation

As described by Ethical Skeptic, pivots are the two points which don't change their rotational paths during the ECDO event.
- The western pivot near Mount Roraima rotates counter-clockwise.
- The eastern pivot in Indonesia rotates clockwise.

Pivots are very close to the equator; the western pivot is slightly above it and the eastern pivot slightly below.

## Triggers

Possible triggers are the galactic current sheet, a micronova, a planetary alignment, a periodic comet or simply the Earth letting go.

## Duration

"S1>S2 and S2>S1 are somewhere between 6-24 hours, probably much closer to 6 than 24." - Nobulart

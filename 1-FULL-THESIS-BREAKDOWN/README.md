# Overview

This folder is intended to be an in-depth breakdown and SCIENTIFIC analysis of Ethical Skeptic's ECDO hypothesis.

A reader should be able to come away from this folder with an understanding of precisely why and how the ECDO happens and various first/second/third order effects.

There is a lot to be done here, this folder needs to be filled to the brim.

## Notable Contents

- `s1-to-s2`: All matters concerning the transition from S1 to S2, and an ECDO rotation in general.

## Contents

- `core-mantle`: Information on core-mantle coupling.
- `dzhanibekov`: Information on Dzhanibekov effect.
- `ecdo-frequencey`: Predicting ECDO frequency.
- `s2`: All about S2.
- `s2-to-s1`: All about S2 to S1.

## Information that doesn't belong here

While there is bound to be overlap, adhoc evidence such as myths or frozen animals belong NOT HERE, but in the folder `2-ADHOC-EVIDENCE`.

Additionally, anecdotal evidence about the impending rotation, and predictions about it, belong NOT HERE, but in `3-MONITORING-PRESENT-ROTATION`.

## TODO

Prior knowledge to understand:
- core-mantle magnetic coupling
- Difficulties understanding the Dzhanibekov effect starting with the finding of the principal axes of inertia of an object in rotation including the Earth
    - math definition: eigenvectors of the inertia tensor
    - inertia tensor?

ECDO phenomena to flesh out:
- All differences between S1 and S2
    - Temperature changes (very cold during S2?)
    - poles in S2
- time spent in S2
- transition from S2 back to S1 (slow or fast?)
- Bulge on equator? S1 vs S2?
- Verification of Ethical Skeptic's thesis (hard to know without knowing if there's any information he's not sharing)
- why 104 degrees?
